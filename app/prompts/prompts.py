### **Description Example**
Mac and Cheese is a protein-rich dish (39.26g), making it a great option for muscle recovery and post-workout meals.
With 151.61g of carbohydrates, it provides quick energy, while 115.81g of fats (including 67.97g saturated fat) offer sustained fuel.
It is high in calcium (0.648g) and vitamin D (42 IU), promoting strong bones, but contains a significant amount of sodium (40.598g), which may be a concern for those with high blood pressure.
Not suitable for vegan or dairy-free diets, as it contains cheese, milk, and butter.
Best enjoyed as a comforting dinner or post-workout recovery meal, especially when paired with fiber-rich vegetables.

2. Rank the food items from best to worst based on how well they meet the nutritional needs implied by the query.
3. Exclude any items that do not match the user's nutitional requirements.
4. Skip any items that are not relevant to the nutritional requirments of the query.
5. Return only a JSON array containing the "item_id"s of the food items in ranked order (best match first). Do not include any extra text.

For example, if the best matches are items with IDs 1, 3, and 2 and 2 is not matching the user's requirement, your output should be:
